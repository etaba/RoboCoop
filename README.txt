To set the alarms:
	1) Basic operation: Click NEXT to cycle through the different RoboCoop settings. Click SEL to interact with a setting.
	2) To set the alarms: Cycle through the 4 alarm-setting screens and change the 	hours and minutes of the alarms by using SEL to increase the value.
	3) To set the time: Press NEXT until the screen says SETTING TIME. Press SEL to select the hour. Press NEXT and then repeat to select the minute.
	4) To toggle the alarm on and off, press SEL while on the first screen which displays the time and the state of the alarm.
	5) To disconnect the motor from the pulley, pull apart the pulley bolt from the magnetic bit socket of the motor. The motor pivots downward to make this possible. The pulley is then free and the door can be adjusted. Note that the solenoid door lock will need to be pushed in to allow the door to close
	6) If the screen reads "ERROR", it has fallen in a bad state and must be manually readjusted. Unplug RoboCoop and follow the instructions to manually readjust the door. When the door is closed and locked, restart RoboCoop.
